(this is my current project) 'basic' 2d game engine:
-player has health and a weapon, shoot projectiles, pickup items, maintain an inventory, move around the level, collidide with objects and actors, etc

-collision detection

-customizble binds in .ini

-camera with zoom in/out

-basic npc

-items and inventory

-save game / load game

-cvars w/ console*

-lights (create shadows)

-gamestates and gamestatemachine

-basic level creation with .txt files (at somepoint create a tiled map support)

-melee and projectile weapons with bounces

-pause menu with restart

-sound and texture manager

-view isometric projection in rendering*

-user interface and ui elements

-combatlog

-objects that can be destroyed

(those that are * stared at the end aren't fully implemented/functional)

plans to add:
-support for other views (side), and associated logic with those views (gravity, etc)

-tiled map support for better map editing
